Masterâ€™s Project - Efficient Forensic in IoT using PDP and Blockchain

The aim of this project is to develop a P4 library tool with various types of pre-processing mechanisms to assist network operators in avoiding the complexity of choosing between different types of Blockchains. This approach provides the freedom to accommodate IoT networks within any Blockchain, ensuring the security and immutability of stored data. Once stored, these data guarantee efficient forensics, as they may have been previously processed, filtered, and prioritized by mechanisms within the P4 switch.
